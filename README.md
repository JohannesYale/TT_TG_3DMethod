# TT_TG_3DMethod
Code used to calculate the error estimate for the article: Tibial Tuberosity to Trochlea Groove Distance (TT-TG): Is A Patellar Instability “Gold Standard” Prone to Errors?

Code uses landmark files exported by Simpleware ScanIP to compute TTTG with the 2D and 3D methods as outlined in the manuscript. It also outputs distances and angles the vertical distance required for the error estimate.
